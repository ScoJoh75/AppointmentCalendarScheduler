# AppointmentCalendarScheduler
This is a project that creates an appointment calendar to be used by multiple people to schedule clients appointments.


This project required the use of an existing database and the databse structure could not be edited.

What I learned:
Creating languge variants for language localization.

Adjusting the display for local timezones.

Basic login security and control for displaying data only for the logged in individual and their level of access.
